# About

This is a talk I've been working on and tweaking over a few months now. It's
about my path through geophysics and open-source software, how it's shaped my
research and teaching, what I see as the future of this area (with some tips
for informing yourself on current software best practices), and some of the
research we're doing at the [Computer-Oriented Geoscience
Lab](https://www.compgeolab.org/).

The slides were made with
[reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) using my new talk template
<i class="fa fa-github"></i> [leouieda/talk-template](https://github.com/leouieda/talk-template).
There are links to the slides specific to each time a version of this talk was
given. The source code links contain the underlying HTML code of the slides.

# At University of Kiel

This was another online version of the talk.
It was really nice to connect with the geophysicists at Kiel since
Prof. [Jörg Ebbing](https://www.satellitengeophysik.uni-kiel.de/de/mitarbeiter/joerg_ebbing)'s
group uses [Tesseroids][/papers/paper-tesseroids-2016] and was involved in the
generation of the GOCE gravity gradient grids cited in the talk.
They have also used the [Moho inversion code][/papers/paper-moho-inversion-tesseroids-2016]
and are [getting involved in Fatiando](https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/issues/153).
I added some bits to the end about getting involved in open-source software
projects and finding online communities of practice (with a shout out to the
[Software Underground](https://softwareunderground.org/)).

I was really delighted to get an invitation to speak at my *alma mater*
(roughly 10 years after my graduation).
The talk was also delivered online.
This was the first time delivering this talk in Portuguese, which was a
struggle since I had the words prepared in English already (slides are
still in English, though). I added the latest news of the
[successful reproduction of the Ferguson COVID-19 modelling results](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-020-01685-y).
Funny enough, this talk is heavily inspired on the [last talk I gave there in
2015][/talks/iag-04-2015].

Featuring host [Ricardo I. F. Trindade](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ricardo_Trindade)
and my good friend [Vanderlei](https://www.pinga-lab.org/people/oliveira-jr.html),
who wouldn't stop asking questions.*

# At TU Freiberg

This is the second version of this talk, delivered online. I changed it a bit
to reflect current research presented at [EGU2020][/talks/egu2020] and focus
less on the technical side of development. The online delivery was new to me
but it worked out well. Even though it can be strange to talk to a screen for
50 minutes, the great questions afterwards more than made up for it.

# At the Geographic Data Science Lab

<i class="fa fa-map-marker"></i> Location: Geographic Data Science Lab, University of Liverpool

This is the first version of this talk, delivered at the GDSL group seminars.
It was about my path through geophysics guided by my interests in making
open-source software: how I got started with coding, the various projects I'm
developing, how that's shaped my research, and plans for the future.
