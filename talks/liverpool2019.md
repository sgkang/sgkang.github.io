# About

I gave this talk at the Earth Sciences Research Group (ESRG) seminar series of
the University of Liverpool. This was my first talk to the department and I
decided to layout why I think open-source development boosts research
productivity and what are the tools we use every day. I hope to help people
find these tools and lead by example in the [Computer-Oriented Geoscience
Lab](https://www.compgeolab.org).

*I had the absolute pleasure of presenting back-to-back with my friend
[David McNamara](https://twitter.com/mcnamadd), who took the picture above.*

# Abstract

In this talk, I'll go over some of my work on open-source geophysics software
(Python and GMT), how we're building communities around them, and how this ties
into my current research and efforts towards reproducibility.
