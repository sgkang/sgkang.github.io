    <h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.software.ac.uk/">Software Sustainability Institute</a> offers
yearly fellowships to fund the organization of communities around scientific
software (creating of local user groups, workshops, hackathons, etc).
I was <a href="/blog/ssi-fellowship.html" title="Advancing research software in the UK through an SSI fellowship">selected to be part of the 2020 cohort of fellows</a>.</p>
<p>All outputs (blogs, posters, papers, talks, etc) related to the fellowship will
be collected under the <span class="label label-default tag tag-link"><a href="/tag/ssi-fellowship">ssi-fellowship</a></span> tag.</p>

<p>And the following is a transcript of the video:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello! My name is Leonardo Uieda. I'm a Lecturer of Geophysics at the
University of Liverpool. This is my application for the Software Sustainability
Institute's 2020 Fellowship program.</p>
<p>First a bit about me. I'm originally from Brazil where I got my Bachelors,
Masters, and PhD in Geophysics. My first contact with programming was as an
undergraduate student and I have been hacking on one project or another ever
since. My Bachelors dissertation project was the development of an
open-source software tool called Tesseroids for modeling gravity data in a
global context. This software went on to be used to process and analyze data
from the European Space Agency's GOCE satellite mission. During my Masters
and PhD, I started the Fatiando a Terra project (which is portuguese for
Slicing the Earth). It is a collection of Python tools for geophysical
modelling. The initial motivation was to build the tools that I needed for my
research and to allow others to reuse my work. Nine years later, Fatiando is
now the foundation for most research done by my former lab. At the lab, I
also started a culture of publishing the code associated with our papers on
Github and figshare, which the lab has continued to do ever since. As a
professor at the State University of Rio de Janeiro, I used open-source
software tools, like Fatiando and Jupyter notebooks, to teach geophysics and
computational thinking. I went on to a visiting researcher position at the
University of Hawaii to work on the Generic Mapping Tools software (or GMT
for short). GMT has been around for 30 years and is now a crucial piece of
infrastructure in many areas of the geosciences. My original job was to
develop a Python interface for GMT. In the end, I also overhauled the
development process by bringing GMT from a self-hosted subversion to Github,
configuring continuous integration, adopting a code of conduct, and pushing
for more emphasis on usability and documentation.</p>
<p>So what have I been up to lately? In August 2019, I joined the University of
Liverpool in the UK as Lecturer of Geophysics, where I'm establishing the
Computer-Oriented Geoscience lab. My main goal for the lab is invest in
open-source software and train our members to participate in open-source
communities. I'm a topic editor for the Journal of Open Source Software
(JOSS) and I've recently registered as a Software Carpentry instructor. In
the past couple of years, I have gotten together with a group of like-minded
geoscientists to organize an open-source software initiative at the American
Geophysical Union. We seek to elevate the role of software within our
community by organizing discussions, tutorials, and sessions around
open-source software.</p>
<p>If I'm awarded the fellowship, I plan to work towards three main goals:</p>
<p>First, I want to bring together a local group at the University of Liverpool
to share knowledge, tools, approaches to science, and organize workshops,
like Software Carpentry. There are some isolated groups developing research
software around the University and my goal would be to bring them together.
This would include giving talks in other departments about software
development best practices, reproducible research, and how to get credit for
software work through JOSS.</p>
<p>Second, I will connect with other UK and European geoscientists who develop
open-source software to discuss the creation of an open-source initiative at
the European Geosciences Union. Their annual meeting gathers 10s of thousands
of geoscientists from the UK, Europe, and the rest of the world. The same
issues we have been addressing within the American Geophysical Union, like
recognition for software work and publishing software tools, also need to be
discussed within the EGU. An exciting possibility would be to establish a
partnership between JOSS and EGU journals to promote the publication of
high-quality software.</p>
<p>Third, I will work to fill in the knowledge gap between the basics of coding
(which are well covered by Software Carpentry) and the day-to-day practices
of most modern open-source software projects. Things like setting up
continuous integration, reviewing pull requests, structuring documentation,
and packaging are very challenging to learn but not usually taught. Often,
scientists are not even aware that these things exist. At the 2018 American
Geophysical Union meeting, we ran a workshop covering these topics. It was
sold out and the feedback we received from participants indicates that there
is a lot of interest in learning these skills. With the fellowship I will
work on generating a Software Carpentry-style lesson out of our workshop
material. To test and iterate on the content, I'll run one or two workshops
at the University of Liverpool or another UK institution.</p>
<p>To reiterate, my plan is to establish a local community in Liverpool, discuss
the creation of an open-source initiative at EGU, and create educational
materials to fill the gap between novice and expert coders.</p>
<p>More than any amount of money, the most important thing I have to gain from
the fellowship is the connection with past and current fellows and the
institute as a whole. What I have come to realize is that coding is just the
tip of the iceberg. The most challenging part is nurturing and maintaining a
healthy community of practice. The SSI fellows are an amazing cohort of
experienced communicators, open-science advocates, and passionate members of
the UK software community. I have much to learn from everyone and would love
to work together to make UK science the best it can be.</p>
